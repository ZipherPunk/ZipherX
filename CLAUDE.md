# ZipherX Project Instructions

## Project Overview

ZipherX is a secure, decentralized cryptocurrency wallet for iOS based on Zclassic/Zcash technology. The goal is to achieve full-node-level security on mobile without requiring a full node.

## Architecture

See `ZipherX-iOS-Wallet-Architecture.md` for complete technical specification.

### Key Principles

1. **Trustless verification** - Verify all transactions locally using cryptographic proofs
2. **Decentralized network** - Connect to 8+ random peers, require consensus
3. **Hardware security** - Use iOS Secure Enclave for key protection
4. **User-controlled backup** - BIP39 mnemonic seed phrases

## Development Guidelines

### Security Requirements

- NEVER store unencrypted private keys
- ALWAYS use Secure Enclave for spending key operations
- NEVER trust a single network peer
- ALWAYS verify Sapling proofs locally
- ALWAYS require multi-peer consensus for balance/transaction queries

### Code Standards

- Swift for iOS UI and Secure Enclave integration
- C++/Rust for cryptographic operations (librustzcash)
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI for new UI components

### Build Instructions

```bash
# iOS build requires:
# - Xcode 14+
# - iOS 14.0+ SDK
# - Rust with aarch64-apple-ios target

# Install Rust iOS target
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios

# Build librustzcash for iOS
cd librustzcash
cargo build --target aarch64-apple-ios --release

# Open Xcode project
open ZipherX.xcodeproj
```

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all cryptographic operations
- Integration tests for multi-peer consensus
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Security audit before release

## Key Components

### 1. Secure Key Storage (`SecureKeyStorage.swift`)

```swift
// Use Secure Enclave for all spending key operations
// Keys NEVER leave the hardware security module
```

### 2. Multi-Peer Network (`NetworkManager.swift`)

```swift
// Connect to MIN_PEERS (8) nodes
// Require CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD (6) agreement
// Rotate peers periodically
```

### 3. Proof Verification (`SaplingVerifier.swift`)

```swift
// Verify all Sapling proofs locally
// Use librustzcash_sapling_check_spend
// ~50ms per proof on modern devices
```

### 4. Compact Filters (`FilterManager.swift`)

```swift
// Download BIP-158 compact block filters
// ~1000x more efficient than full blocks
// Detect relevant transactions without revealing addresses
```

## Security Checklist

Before any release:

- [ ] All private keys encrypted at rest
- [ ] Secure Enclave used for key operations
- [ ] Multi-peer consensus implemented
- [ ] Sapling proofs verified locally
- [ ] BIP39 mnemonic backup tested
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Network traffic encrypted (TLS)
- [ ] Code signing and notarization
- [ ] Security audit completed

## Dependencies

| Library | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| librustzcash | Sapling cryptography | Cross-compile for iOS |
| libsodium | Crypto primitives | Use CocoaPods/SPM |
| SQLCipher | Encrypted database | Use CocoaPods/SPM |
| Reachability | Network monitoring | Use SPM |

## Important Notes

- **Never disable SSL verification** - Always verify certificates
- **Never use hardcoded credentials** - Generate randomly
- **Never trust single peer responses** - Always verify with multiple
- **Never skip proof verification** - Security depends on it
- **Always backup before encryption** - No recovery without seed phrase

## Phase Timeline

1. **Phase 1 (4-6 weeks)**: Core security - Secure Enclave, BIP39, proof verification
2. **Phase 2 (6-8 weeks)**: Network layer - Multi-peer, compact filters, header sync
3. **Phase 3 (4-6 weeks)**: Shielded support - Note scanning, TX construction
4. **Phase 4 (2-4 weeks)**: Polish - Background sync, notifications, audit

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features

1. **BIP-39 Mnemonic Support** - Generate/validate 24-word seed phrases
2. **Sapling Key Derivation** - ExtendedSpendingKey, IVK, payment addresses
3. **Note Decryption** - Trial decryption with IVK/SK (fixed EPK byte order)
4. **Nullifier Computation** - Track spent notes
5. **Transaction Scanning** - Via Insight API with shielded output detection
6. **Commitment Tree** - Full implementation for witness generation
   - Tree init/append/serialize/deserialize
   - IncrementalWitness creation and updates
   - Database persistence of tree state
7. **Witness Generation** - Real Merkle path witnesses (1028 bytes)
8. **Database Layer** - SQLite with tree state persistence
9. **UI** - System 7-inspired interface with balance display, send/receive

### In Progress / Needs Testing

1. **Transaction Building** - Spend proof generation needs testing with real witnesses
2. **Spend Detection** - Nullifier tracking during rescan
3. **GitHub Repository** - Created but push needs retry (HTTP 400 error)

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Rescan for Existing Wallet** - Must delete old tree state and rescan from beginning to build proper commitment tree
2. **Test Full Send Flow** - With new witness generation
3. **Add Checkpoint Support** - Pre-computed tree state for faster initial sync
4. **Multi-Peer Consensus** - Currently single API endpoint
5. **Background Sync** - iOS background fetch
6. **Secure Enclave Integration** - Currently keys in memory
7. **Security Audit** - Required before any real use

### Technical Notes

- **Witness Format**: 4 bytes (u32 LE position) + 32×32 bytes (Merkle path) = 1028 bytes
- **Tree State Size**: ~350KB - 1.7MB depending on network usage
- **Full Sync Time**: ~30-60 minutes without checkpoint (sequential block processing required)
- **FFI Header**: `/Users/chris/ZipherX/Libraries/zipherx-ffi/include/zipherx_ffi.h`

### Known Issues

- Sequential block processing slower than parallel (required for tree ordering)
- Existing notes may have placeholder witnesses - need rescan
- Nullifier computation uses tree position (must match witness)
